                What is the Difference between SQL and NoSQL?

                SQL dialects share many properties though they interface with
                distinct databases. Flavors of NoSQL vary far more across their
                attendant systems, so comparison can be more useful between
                multiple non-relational technologies vs. SQL generally. Perhaps
                the most recognizable SQL dialect is MySQL, an open source and
                free RDBMS (though available through proprietary licenses as
                well). Its use is widespread in web applications, and it is
                known for compatibility, support, and good performance in the
                average case. MySQL has also made concessions to NoSQL
                practitioners with features like a JSON data type, the “Document
                Store,” and support for sharding (horizontal scaling). On the
                non-relational side, MongoDB is primarily a document store
                containing JSON-like structures and a JavaScript interface. It’s
                known for being user-friendly (less administration overhead),
                performant for simple queries, and flexible thanks to its NoSQL
                underpinnings. Great for hierarchical data storage, it also
                supports familiar relational concepts from indexing, to
                aggregation, to some measure of ACID compliance. Like MySQL, it
                is compatible with many platforms and programming environments,
                despite relative recency.

                What is JWT, and how does it work?

                JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely
                transmitting information between parties as JSON object. It is
                compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a
                public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP). So the integrity
                and authenticity of the token can be verified by other parties
                involved. The purpose of using JWT is not to hide data but to
                ensure the authenticity of the data. JWT is signed and encoded,
                not encrypted. JWT is a token based stateless authentication
                mechanism. Since it is a client-side based stateless session,
                server doesn't have to completely rely on a datastore(database)
                to save session information.

                JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used
                with any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node.
                js, on the other hand, is an interpreter or execution
                environment for the JavaScript programming language.

                How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?

                NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into
                EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven
                architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite
                loop that receives requests and processes them.EventLoop is the
                listener for the EventQueue. If NodeJS can process the request
                without I/O blocking then the event loop would itself process
                the request and sends the response back to the client by itself.
                But, it is possible to process multiple requests parallelly
                using the NodeJS cluster module or worker_threads module.
